## About
newTab is a Firefox extension that changes the appearance of the new tab page. It has a simple design with just a Firefox logo and text in the center of the screen, and a solid colour background. There is a side menu that can be accessed by clicking the settings icon in the top right corner. From the menu, you can choose from a variety of backgrounds to use as your new tab background. Just click on one of the options to set it as your background. If you want to go back to the solid colour background, simply click on the selected image again to deselect it. All the photos have credits in the bottom left corner.

## Why?
I created this extension because when I switched from Chrome to Firefox, I missed the background customization feature that Chrome has on its new tab page. I like to have a cool background on my new tabs, and I initially tried using custom CSS to add a background to the default Firefox new tab page. However, I found this method to be somewhat limiting, as I had to go into the profile folder to change the image. I searched the Firefox extensions website but couldn't find anything that I liked. So I decided to make my own extension. This was also an excuse for me to learn how to create extensions and a perfect project to get started with.
